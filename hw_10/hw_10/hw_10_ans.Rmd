There was a major descend in life expectancy in Rwanda from 1990 to 1996. There was a genocide in 1993 which caused life expectancy for a country to descend to its minimum  after 1981. During the genocide, it is estimated that 500000 to 1000000 Rwandas were killed.

first, we'll see if there is a correlation between income equality (GINI index) and GDP:
```{r}
data %>% select(Country.Code, X1960:X2017, Indicator.Name) %>% filter(Indicator.Name %in% c("GDP (current US$)", "GINI index (World Bank estimate)")) %>% gather(key = "year", value = "val", X1960:X2017) %>% spread(Indicator.Name, val) -> data10.1
data10.1$`GDP (current US$)`[is.na(data10.1$`GDP (current US$)`)] <- -1
data10.1$`GINI index (World Bank estimate)`[is.na(data10.1$`GINI index (World Bank estimate)`)] <- -1
data10.1 %>% filter(`GDP (current US$)` > -1) %>% filter(`GINI index (World Bank estimate)` > -1) -> data10.1

cor.test(data10.1$`GDP (current US$)`, data10.1$`GINI index (World Bank estimate)`)
```
We can see the P-value is very low. So there is a correlation between GDP and GINI Index.   

Now we want to see if there is a relation between population of a country and its GINI Index.
```{r}
data %>% select(Country.Code, X1960:X2017, Indicator.Name) %>% filter(Indicator.Name %in% c("Population, total", "GINI index (World Bank estimate)")) %>% gather(key = "year", value = "val", X1960:X2017) %>% spread(Indicator.Name, val) -> data10.2
data10.2$`Population, total`[is.na(data10.2$`Population, total`)] <- -1
data10.2$`GINI index (World Bank estimate)`[is.na(data10.2$`GINI index (World Bank estimate)`)] <- -1
data10.2 %>% filter(`Population, total` > -1) %>% filter(`GINI index (World Bank estimate)` > -1) -> data10.2

cor.test(data10.2$`Population, total`, data10.2$`GINI index (World Bank estimate)`)
```
P-value is still very low. So there is also a correlation between population of a country and its state of being equal.    

Now we will check if there is a correlation between labor force and GDP:
```{r}
data %>% select(Country.Code, X1960:X2017, Indicator.Name) %>% filter(Indicator.Name %in% c("GDP (current US$)", "Labor force, total")) %>% gather(key = "year", value = "val", X1960:X2017) %>% spread(Indicator.Name, val) -> data10.3
data10.3$`GDP (current US$)`[is.na(data10.3$`GDP (current US$)`)] <- -1
data10.3$`Labor force, total`[is.na(data10.3$`Labor force, total`)] <- -1
data10.3 %>% filter(`GDP (current US$)` > -1) %>% filter(`Labor force, total` > -1) -> data10.3

cor.test(data10.3$`GDP (current US$)`, data10.3$`Labor force, total`)
```
P-value is very low. There is correlation between these two factors (As we can expect).
